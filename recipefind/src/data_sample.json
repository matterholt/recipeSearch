pairingText: "Banh Mi on the menu? Try pairing with Chenin Blanc, Gewurztraminer, and Riesling. The best wine for Asian food depends on the cuisine and dish - of course - but these acidic whites pair with a number of traditional meals, spicy or not. One wine you could try is Lubanzi Chenin Blanc. It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 16 dollars."
